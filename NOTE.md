# Project Overview

## Purpose

This project aims to develop a delivery fee calculator application.

To set up the project:

1. Download the zip file
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install required modules.

### Technology Stack

The project remains lightweight without additional libraries for handling inputs due to its small scope.

### Folder Structure

The project structure includes:

- `src/components`: Houses `deliveryFeeCalculator.tsx`.
- `src/constants`: Contains `deliveryFeeConstants.tsx`.
- `src/helper`: Holds `calculatorHelper.tsx`.

## Description

To maintain code clarity and organization:

- Constants: Constants related to delivery fee calculations are centralized in the `deliveryFeeCalculator.tsx` file for easier management.

- Helper Functions: Functions assisting in calculations but not directly altering the state are separated into the `calculatorHelper.tsx` file. 

- Component Separation: While the application could have been further divided into components, essential functions were segregated to preserve simplicity within the small-scale scope of the project.
